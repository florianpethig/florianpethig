I previously worked as a business data analyst at <a href="https://www.zerog.aero">zeroG</a> (Lufthansa Group), specializing in data science and the digital transformation. My research into digital platforms and the digitization of organizations is geared toward understanding how technology impacts the behavior and welfare of people.

My work has been presented at conferences in information systems and marketing, including the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), the Symposium on Statistical Challenges in Electronic Commerce Research (SCECR), the Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems (WITS), and the Marketing Science Conference. I have received funding from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Joachim Herz Foundation, and Wikimedia Deutschland.
